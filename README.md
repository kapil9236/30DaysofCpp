<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview üìù
 **"30 Days of Cpp"** . 
It is a guide for people to learn programming (C++) in the best effiecient way possible, irrespective of their current level of expertise. After this 30 Days of learning you will be able to write codes in C++ efficiently and confidently.

let's start with **"30 Days of Cpp"** . 
<br/>

<!-- Introduction to C++ -->
## Introduction to C++
**C++** is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or **"C with Classes"**.<br/>
**Why to learn C++?** <br/>
C++ is the most **fundamental** programming langauge. It's easy to learn,implement, and ample amount of sources to learn it. All the possible programming codes you can find in C++.<br/>
Being an **object oriented programming** langauge it enables us to code **efficiently and more easily**.<br/>
So, let's learn C++ !

<!-- Basic Overview of C++ -->
## Basic Overview of C++
<!-- Day 1-5 -->
### Day 1-5
Having overview of things you learning boosts your **confidence** and creates **a learning mindset**, we are also going to do the same.<br/>
Before diving into programming, first let's look at things you will be learning here!<br/>
<br/>
[Click on Introduction to C++!](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp)<br/>
<br/>
**Best way to start with w3schools** :-<br/>
Just read all the content on website and try to understand things.<br/>
**Don't take notes and try to go in deep.**<br/>
We will do everthing **gradually and efficiently**.
<br/>
Read all the basics till functions and try to solve basic questions given on the website.<br/>
<br/>
You can take up to **5 Days** to learn it all however you can always go with your pace :)<br/>
**Everything takes time and efforts and we will learn it all, in these 5 days recommended that don't try for solving complex problems!**<br/>
<!-- Day 6 -->
### Day 6
Attempt the quizes given in the below link. It will a quick recap about what you learnt at 
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp). Whereever you feel lost, just [google](https://www.google.com/) it.<br/>

## Learning C++ basics
<!-- Install IDE -->
### Install an IDE to Code
Before we start real learning lets install an IDE to compile and run the code. There are multiple options for an IDE, anyway we will use Dev C++ IDE that comes with versatility of coding in 30 different programming langauges.<br/>
[download and setup Dev-C++ IDE from here](http://www.bloodshed.net/).<br/>

We will start learning topics in the below sequence:-<br/>
* [Data Types & Type Modifiers](https://youtu.be/cnT1oW5_ePM)<br/>
* [Input/Output in C++](https://youtu.be/7dPdMtBX1d8)
* [if else statement in C++](https://youtu.be/cyB3HNlQyjY)
* [Introduction to loops in C++](https://youtu.be/IlIn_D1RT7M)
* [Break and Continue statement in C++](https://youtu.be/Stf7KBiA1vs)
